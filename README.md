# MauiAppSample: MAUIBlazor project

I created this project in MAUI Blazor to explore a frontend framework for developing web, desktop, and mobile applications, even though I don't appreciate the structural approach of this framework. But hey, if you don't try, you can't judge (and why not inflict a little pain on yourself, right?).

I used another Learning Playground of mine, a backend built in Java Springboot(here)[https://github.com/KydoDev/SpringbootTutorial], also built to approach a technology stack that I have always avoided.

Let's see if I'll make it through this project to the end :-)
